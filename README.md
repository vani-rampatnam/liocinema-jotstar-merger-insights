# liocinema-jotstar-merger-insights
Data Analytics Project from Codebasics
Author: VANI R.A.C
<br>
Project Description:
Lio Cinema and Jotstar are two major OTT platforms, each with thousands of subscribers.
<br>
These two platforms are merging into one, so we need to analyze their data separately before the merger.

After studying the entire database thoroughly, I have built a dashboard with business insights, including:
<br>
Content Library: Total number of content available on Lio Cinema vs. Jotstar.

Active vs. Inactive Users, Upgrade and Downgrade Percentage, Content Consumption Behavior, Revenue Analysis for each platform.

Recommendations based on the analysis.
